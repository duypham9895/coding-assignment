# Coding Assignment

## Exercise 1

### Description:

Given an integer array, all items repeat 3 times except for just one item that appears once. Please find this single item.

Example 1:<br />
INPUT: [1, 1, 0, 1]<br />
OUTPUT: 0<br />

Example 2:<br />
INPUT: [3, 1, 3, 3, 5, 1, 1]<br />
OUTPUT: 5

## Exercise 2

### Description

Given a binary tree, return the sum of values of nodes with even-valued grandparent. (A
grandparent of a node is the parent of its parent, if it exists.)
If there are no nodes with an even-valued grandparent, return 0.

Example:

![Alt text](./images/tree.png?raw=true "Binary Search Tree")

INPUT: [6, 7, 8, 2, 7, 1, 3, 9, null, 1, 4, null, null, null, 5] <br />
OUTPUT: 18

Explanation: The red nodes are the nodes with even-value grandparent while the
blue nodes are the even-value grandparents.

# How to run the program

## Run Exercise 1:

We will run this program by command line:

```
    node ex1.js
```

And this is result of the program:

![Alt text](./images/result_1.png?raw=true "Result of Exercise 1")

## Run Exercise 2:

We will run this program by command line:

```
    node ex2.js
```

The tree will use in this program:

![Alt text](./images/example_tree.png?raw=true "Example Tree")

And this is result of the program:

![Alt text](./images/result_2.png?raw=true "Result of Exercise 2")

# Notes

All my explanations will be in my source code. Mainly because this will help you to follow my explanations of my code and you will find it easy more than.
